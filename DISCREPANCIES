Certificate signing requests are not generated quite the same way that the
official client generates them. The CA apparently doesn't care currently.

Information regarding the user's system is not sent, including the MAC
addresses of network interfaces. This is important because it's possible that
USU's networking hardware checks your MAC address against what it expects it to
be before forwarding the association request to the RADIUS server. It would
appear, however, that this is not the case currently.
